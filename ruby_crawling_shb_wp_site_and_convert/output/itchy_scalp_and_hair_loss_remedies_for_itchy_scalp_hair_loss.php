$page_content = <<<END
<p>Itchy scalp hair loss problems often are the result of excessive oil secretion form the scalp &#8211; sebum. Sebum acts to help coat and protect the follicle shaft and provide nutrients and minerals while adding smoothing lubrication.</p>
<p>Associated with all follicle pores, the sebaceous glands can become overactive and lead to oily hair and scalp. Considered a primary cause of dermatitis, excess sebum can lead to inflammation, itching and flaking. Itchiness is often caused by bacterial build-up and be accelerated by styling, dirt and styling product residue.</p>
<p>Allergic or sensitive reactions to shampoo, conditioners, chemical treatments and environmental factors can increase itchiness and localized redness and irritation. Dandruff, flakiness, scalp bumps and even sores can develop &#8211; eventually leading to thinning or hair loss.</p>
<p>More severe signs of loss may be the result of scalp psoriasis, ringworm or may be the result of physical tension as a result of tight braiding and &#8220;traction alopecia&#8221; &#8211; keeping the hair bound or styled tightly. Extended tension can cause irritation resulting in itchy scalp hair loss problems.</p>
<p>Remedies for itchy scalp hair loss problems focus on two primary concerns. One, reducing or regulating sebum production (oil), and two, soothing and healing the scalp.</p>
<p>A shampoo for itchy scalp is recommended to slow or regulate oil. Zinc is known to help slow and temper oil secretion and help cleanse oily scalp. Combined with botanical extracts that are less irritating to the scalp, you can deep clean dirt and product residue accumulation while increasing blood flow, circulation and nutrient delivery to the follicle root and cuticle.</p>
<p>Common herbs used in hair loss products include Sage, Thyme and Fenugreek and have been shown to help in the regrowth process while avoiding irritation and inflammation. When used with Zinc or Zinc PCA, sebaceous glands can be regulated and oil production reduced.</p>
<p>To soothe itching and help heal the scalp, Panthenol, Jojoba Oil and Emu Oil are used to penetrate the scalp and act as an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial compound. Emu Oil has been used extensively in hair loss products and skin care for its ability to penetrate the dermal layers and help soothe itchiness, flaking, redness and irritation.</p>
<p>Used in conditioners for itchy scalp, these ingredients help promote healthy hair, while adding fullness and body to thin or thinning hair. Used in conjunction with an oil regulating shampoo, you can get viable remedies for itchy scalp hair loss.</p>
<p>Itching, flaking and scalp bumps may be the sign of something more severe and might require the care of either a dermatologist or trichologist. However, many itchy scalp hair loss issues can be effectively addressed by shampoos and conditioners formulated to clean the hair, regulate sebum, and soothe and condition the follicles and scalp.</p>
