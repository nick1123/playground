<p>It is noteworthy that Chinese angelica, which is one of the main ingredients of this Female-used Evergreen hair regenerator, is widely used in traditional Chinese gynecology as a medicine for curing diseases and a tonic for improving health. Its extract has the additional advantage of being able to penetrate easily through the skin and, for this reason, is employed very often as a transdermal passage promoter.</p>
<p>In our case, the extract of Chinese angelica carries with it the extracts of the other ingredients to pass through the skin smoothly so as to reach the hair follicles that need regeneration and to pervade together with the other ingredients the environment of hair follicles inside the scalp and provide them with added nutrients. Of these other ingredients, special mention must be made of the tuber of multiflower knotweed, which is reputed to possess a wonderful power of enabling hair to regrow. It has the popular nickname of Blackhead. This nickname came from a folk story, which runs as follows:</p>
<p>Many years ago an old man was stranded on a desolate island as a result of shipwreck. He had to live in a cave and depend on the tuber of multiflower knotweed as his staple food for more than ten years. Fortunately, a ship sailed by and noticed his signal for help. He was saved and carried back to his native village. His fellow villagers were surprised to find that his white hair had turned black. He attributed this change to the tuber of that herb on which he had subsisted.</p>
<p>As no one ever made any experiment to test the truth of the story by subsisting on the tuber for ten years, what the old man related to the villagers remains a folk story. However, the nickname that has been given to the herb shows that Chinese people believe that the herb has the ability of rehabilitating hair. Our female customer does not need to depend on Evergreen hair regenerator long. It will take her only one month or three months at most to see her beautiful hair growing gracefully again.</p>
