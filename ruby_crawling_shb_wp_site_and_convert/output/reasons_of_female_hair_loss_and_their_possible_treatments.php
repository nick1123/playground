<p>One of the things that can truly devastate the life of a woman is female hair loss. That is no joke and since women value their crowning glory, they are bound to do everything just to keep a healthy and beautiful hair.</p>
<p>Hair loss among men is an ordinary story but in case you don&#8217;t know it is also a widespread problem for women. However, women are not as vocal as men in expressing their concerns.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the condition occurring, you must be able to understand its causes. Often the problem is attributed to many things. Try to observe your hair and check if it&#8217;s getting thin or maybe you&#8217;re losing hair in some spots of the scalp. Once you perceive that something is wrong with your hair, consult a doctor, dermatologist, or a hair specialist.</p>
<p>The most common cause is the disturbance of hormones in the body. Every time your body stops or slows down, the hormone production undergoes some changes and it can affect the growth of your hair.</p>
<p>Here are some of the causes of hair loss among women:</p>
<p>1. Menopause</p>
<p>Menopause is part of growing old and when a woman enters this period, the hormone production slows down. Since the level of hormones are reduced, about 2/3 women on their post-menopausal stage often find themselves having bald spots. The best treatment preferred by most women is the hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>Before the menopausal stage, high levels of estrogen are produced inside a woman&#8217;s body. Aside from estrogen, the body also produces testosterone. The estrogen serves as a barrier that protects the testosterone hormones from being converted. But since menopause can&#8217;t be stopped as it is a natural occurrence, estrogen production is slowed down until it finally stops. Testosterone will then combine with bodily enzymes and alpha reductase. The result is the production of DHT which is said to be primarily responsible for hair loss.</p>
<p>2. Hysterectomy</p>
<p>Even if a woman undergoes a hysterectomy, the production of hormones is still affected and the woman will experience the symptoms associated with menopause. But if you choose the full hysterectomy, there is a great chance that you will suffer from hair loss.</p>
<p>3. Pregnancy</p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, a lot of bodily changes take place. You will eventually notice that your hair is falling or thinning but there have also been ironical cases wherein the individual&#8217;s hair thickens. Those that have straight hair may suddenly find that it now curls and vice versa. You must see to it that you are getting all the needed nutrients; that is the reason why you need to take vitamins when pregnant.</p>
<p>Aside from menopause, hysterectomy, and pregnancy, the problem can also be caused by genetics. Pattern baldness has a lot to do with this and it will run in the family. Another factor that contributes to this is your diet. You must eat the right kinds of food in their proper amounts to keep your body and hair healthy. Frequent styling can also lead to hair loss also try to minimize colouring, highlighting, or bleaching.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of female hair loss products offered in the market. Ask your doctor which ones you can use. Don&#8217;t take hair loss problem lightly; act on it now.</p>
