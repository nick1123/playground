<p>Some of the “legends” I have heard over the years about female hair loss are : Wigs and hats may cause female hair loss, Female hair loss indicates an energetic brain, A frequently washing of the hair or over brushing or combing it may cause hair loss and hair shaving will make the hair re grow thicker.</p>
<p>Female hair loss most popular type is the female pattern hair loss. It is a hereditary type which might be inherited from each of the parents. To make things simple, the cause of the female pattern hair loss is a chemical called DHT.</p>
<p>The female pattern hair loss usually becomes stronger at the age of menopause. It’s symptoms are thinning of the hair over the sides and the top of the head.</p>
<p>There are 4 available products to treat female hair loss:</p>
<p>1. Medical treatments like Rogaine. Rogaine is one of only two FDA approved hair loss treatments and it remains the only one approved for use by women. Rogaine or minoxidil also helps high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Rogaine works on about 50% of female hair loss cases but not always with the same efficiency. It comes as a lotion that you have to put on your scalp.</p>
<p>2. Wigs or hair thickeners – theses cosmetic female hair loss products may help you save a lot of time, money and discomfort using other kinds of products.</p>
<p>However, many women feel insecure and in natural with the cosmetic female hair loss products. Do not be afraid to change styles and products until you are satisfied.</p>
<p>3. The last and least recommended female hair loss treatment is a hair transplantation surgery. Although there has been a significant improvement with the outcomes of those surgeries a severe risk still exists.</p>
<p>The principle of the hair transplant is transplanting hair follicles from the body ( the back of the head for example) on the scalp. It is a pain full long process.</p>
<p>In some cases, female hair loss can be a mental symptom. Therefore, it is advised to wait a while before using any of the female hair loss products mentioned above.</p>
