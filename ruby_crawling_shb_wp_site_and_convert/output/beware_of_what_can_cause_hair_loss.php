<p>You will find all sorts of information circulating the internet and elsewhere about what can cause you to lose your hair. However you need to be aware of some that are definitely causes of thinning hair.</p>
<p>First let&#8217;s address some of the lies that are being spread by the media and other so-called &#8216;know-it alls&#8217; who really know nothing about the underlying causes of a thinning hair condition. You will hear all sorts of tales such as &#8216;if you wear a cap too much you will lose hair&#8217;, or &#8216;washing your hair too much will result in you going bald&#8217;.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by these things. They are just myths being spread by those who are too paranoid to understand that people lose hair for legitimate reasons. Here are a few below:</p>
<p>1.) <strong> Prescription medications </strong></p>
<p>2.) <strong> Lack of blood circulation in the scalp </strong></p>
<p>3.) <strong> Lack of vital nutrients for hair growth </strong></p>
<p>4.) <strong> High levels of the DHT hormone </strong></p>
<p>5.) <strong> Hormonal imbalances </strong></p>
<p>6.) <strong> Stress </strong></p>
<p>7.) <strong> Heredity </strong></p>
<p>All of these are your various causes for losing hair. You probably wondered why on earth is number seven concerning heredity crossed out? Well like some of the other myths circulating the globe, heredity isn&#8217;t a definite cause for losing hair.</p>
<p>I know it sounds strange and hard to believe, but consider this. Scientists now know that male and female pattern baldness is linked to a hormone called DHT. This hormone binds to your hair follicle cells and weakens them till they die.</p>
<p>Everyone has this hormone present in their bodies, the only difference is that those with healthy growing hair have less of it. Hair loss sufferers the total opposite. You must learn to control this hormone if you ever plan on getting your hair back and keeping it.</p>
