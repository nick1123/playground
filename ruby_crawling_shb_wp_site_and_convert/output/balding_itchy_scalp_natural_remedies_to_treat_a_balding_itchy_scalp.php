<p>A balding itchy scalp can be a difficult thing to endure. The hair loss can be sudden, and the accompanying itch can drive you mad. What can you do to treat an balding itchy scalp problem, and are there any natural remedies to take care of, and cure it?</p>
<p>Is A Balding Itchy Scalp A Normal Part Of Pattern Baldness?</p>
<p>An itchy scalp is not a symptom of male or female pattern baldness (the most common natural form of balding and hair loss. The fancy medical name for this is Androgenetic Alopecia. Pattern baldness is currently understood to be mainly a genetic and hormonal problem due to androgens particularly an androgen called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and is not seen to be accompanied by an itchy scalp.</p>
<p>This could be good news as in most cases of balding itchy scalp, the hair loss is only temporary and not permanent. So by treating and curing the itchy scalp condition, your hair should eventually grow back.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are suffering from a balding itchy scalp it could be one of the following:</p>
<p>Ringworm (tinea capitis) &#8211; this is a particularly aggressive and contagious fungus that can produce symptoms like red, itchy burning patches on the scalp, hair loss and if left untreated can lead to cicatricial alopecia, i.e. permanent hair loss.</p>
<p>Ringworm requires some pretty tough treatment to clear it up and I would recommend you see your doctor or dermatologist for advice on this. Most prescriptions involve a medication like miconazole, clotrimazole or similar ingredients. There are natural antibiotics available that can be used to tackle this nasty fungal infection.</p>
<p>Psoriasis is an extremely common condition, and psoriasis of the scalp can lead to temporary hair loss. It is normally identifiable as white scales on patches of very red skin, severe itching and temporary baldness on the affected areas.</p>
<p>Natural Remedies To Treat A Balding Itchy Scalp</p>
<p>First thing to do is look at your shampoo and bathing habits. Have either of these changed lately? Are you using a new shampoo? Have you recently had your hair dyed or been to the hairdressers?</p>
<p>Often times the beginnings of scalp reactions and infections can be traced back to the products we put on our hair. Look out for harsh chemicals that dry out your scalp like Sodium Laureth Sulphate (SLS) &#8211; as this will only serve to aggravate your balding itchy scalp problem.</p>
<p>Try using a shampoo containing Zinc Pyrithione (the natural stuff, not the synthetic one). This is commonly used as an anti-dandruff ingredient, as it has very strong anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties.</p>
<p>Home remedies that make use of birch or avocado oil are extremely effective in soothing and healing psoriasis.</p>
<p>Natural essential oils such as Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lavender and Manuka are superb at treating balding itchy scalp problems and can even stimulate hair growth. Combined with a scalp massage they can alleviate the symptoms of balding itchy scalp.</p>
