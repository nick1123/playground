<p>Hair loss is a condition that affects both sexes. Although to a lesser degree compared to males, females also experience hair loss. In fact, it has been found that hair loss in females is more widespread than was previously believed with over 25 million Americans suffering the symptoms and effects of hair loss and the stress it causes. The emotional and psychological effects of hair loss are also far greater in women than in men since hair is considered an essential part of an attractive and positive image.</p>
<p>One of the causes of female hair loss is not really hereditary genes but the temporary problems in metabolism that commonly accompanies conditions such as pregnancy, stress, medications, anorexia, surgery, infection and other serious medical problems. Taking certain drugs will also negatively affect hair with effects ranging from dryness and brittleness to falling hair. Meanwhile, female pattern baldness results in considerable thinning of the hair, though not in a degree more commonly seen in males. Another cause of hair loss in women is the declining level of estrogen.</p>
<p>Like in men, effectively treating hair loss in women starts with determining the cause. Usually, if the hair loss is caused by a temporary medical problem such as those cited earlier, the symptoms will simply stop as soon as the cause ends. Other treatment of hair loss in women includes medications such as Finasteride, which is in tablet form and works by blocking the circulation of androgen. Minoxidil is also one of the most common prescription hair loss medications available.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of new medications that are introduced to the market. Hair transplantation, a surgical operation still remains as the most effective way to treat serious hair loss and with natural-looking results. Researchers and doctors are also continuously searching for new drugs or techniques to help prevent and treat hair loss in women.</p>
