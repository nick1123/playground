<p>Baldness can be very distressing; even if you&#8217;re a man and baldness is considered normal it can damage your self confidence and stop you wanting to do anything. This would cause many people to visit your doctor; if you talk to your doctor then they might say that there is no way to cure hair loss.</p>
<p>Although there are prescription FDA approved medications for treating baldness, there are no methods to cure the condition completely. However there are a number of products available which claim to be able to help you cure your baldness problem.</p>
<p>One treatment is Rogaine; this is also known as Minoxidil and should be applied directly to the scalp twice a day. This medication is available over the counter without the need for a prescription. This is not considered as a baldness cure because you have to continue applying it every day, if you stop using this treatment then your hair will start falling out again. This product actually includes quite a lot of alcohol which has been used for quite some time to treat hair loss naturally.</p>
<p>Anyone suffering from baldness spends a long time searching for a cure. There&#8217;s a lot of money to be made out of these treatments, which is why so many manufacturers claim to be able to cure your baldness. It&#8217;s not a new thing to search for baldness treatments; they have been around for many years.</p>
<p>The ingredients used to create one of the first hair loss solutions were quinine, borax and alcohol. Some of these are quite dangerous and would never be included in baldness cures nowadays. People that made these products stood to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Modern day hair loss treatments are very similar; however do not include some of the more dangerous ingredients. Most of these modern treatments are applied directly to the surface of your scalp using a damp flannel. The solution should be left on the head for a number of hours, or as directed and then rinsed off. These solutions work by reducing the levels of hormones in your body which cause hair loss. This will slow down the rate at which hairs are lots, and should mean that you have a healthy head of hair for longer</p>
<p>There are lots of different baldness cures available these days, which can make it difficult. Why are there so many if they really do work? If there was a cure which worked perfectly for everyone then that would be the only cure available, it would also receive a lot of press coverage.</p>
<p>The baldness cures available will normally only slow down hair loss rather than actually helping you to grow new hair.</p>
