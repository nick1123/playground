<p>The best way to combat hair loss is by ensuring good health of the body as a whole. This is an achievable goal and can easily be attained by strictly monitoring what we take into our body which is our diet.</p>
<p>A good hair diet is free from harmful toxins with all the vital nutrients that are essential for one&#8217;s general well being. Therefore, in order to promote healthy hair, it is very important that we take in food that helps to enrich our hair &#8211; which is also known as good hair diet.</p>
<p>To ensure a good hair diet, the following food can be added to our meals: fish, liver oil, carrots, brewers yeast, citrus fruits, whole grains, egg yolk and green vegetables. These foods are sources of, vitamin A which is an anti-oxidant that improves the health of the scalp, vitamin E which enhances scalp blood circulation and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) a vitamin that delay graying and loss of hair.</p>
<p>Citrus fruit is important to one&#8217;s diet not only as a supply for vitamin C, but also helps the body to absorb iron from non meat sources. A good hair diet would be one that is rich in protein as protein is a basic building block for hair, thus more protein in the diet will translate to stronger hair, less breakage of hair or split ends.</p>
<p>A good hair diet also has to contain lots of water. Water is a major component of the body and of hair. Water keeps the hair silky, soft and shiny. Water is also essential for flushing out of toxins that would otherwise affect circulation of the blood and slow down hair growth.</p>
<p>Silica in the diet is also important in preventing breakage of hair, and it can be found in foods such as potatoes, cucumbers, bean sprouts, green and red peppers. They are all rich in silica and should be incorporated into our hair diet.</p>
<p>Vitamin supplements can also be taken to stimulate the growth of healthy hair. It is important however to note that vitamins should be taken in doses as recommended by a medical doctor, because excess intake of vitamins can cause hair loss and be fatal.</p>
<p>Lastly, we also need to consider what kind of food that is entering our body. For a healthy hair diet, we need to avoid processed food, or food that has high sugar content, high amount of fats, raw food from unreliable source, and food with excessive salt content. We also need to avoid drinking too much alcohol, and smoking.</p>
