<p>Not many people are successful in regrowing their hair. Many resort to the use of expensive creams, pills, and other hair loss treatments. Really though, there are only three simple steps required to regrow hair and stop further loss of your hair.</p>
<p>In order to regrow hair and stop hair loss, you need to do the following below:</p>
<p><strong> 1.) </strong> Discover what&#8217;s causing your hair to come out.</p>
<p><strong> 2.) </strong> Apply a few simple tactics to regrow your hair</p>
<p><strong> 3.) </strong> Avoid commercial shampoo</p>
<p>Just by putting these three simple tactics to good use, you will effectively regrow your hair and maintain it. So now let&#8217;s examine each of these three more closely so that you can be back in the barbershop or beauty salon in no time.</p>
<p>First you need to discover what&#8217;s leading to your hair loss. Many people believe that heredity is the main cause when in reality it&#8217;s usually not. I know it sounds farfetched, but scientists have discovered that baldness in 90% of men and some women is due to a hormone.</p>
<p>This hormone is given the name dihydrotestosterone and is sometimes called DHT for short. Now what DHT does that&#8217;s so bad is bind to your hair follicle cells. It stays attached to your cells till they eventually become very weak and die. Of course you know what the end result usually is when this happens.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;re going to have to find a way to block this hormone. There are several methods for doing this but if you&#8217;re wanting to go the cheap way, I would suggest taking saw palmetto extract as part of your daily supplement routine.</p>
<p>Also too avoid any shampoo containing Sodium Laureth Sulfate. This is a degreasing agent placed in many shampoos to lift dirt and oil. The terrible thing about this ingredient is that it leads to a gradual loss of hair.</p>
