<p>Like many men, a great percentage of women are also seeking for female hair loss treatment. This can even be more worrying if it happens in women. Balding in women or female pattern baldness (FPB) may not be a common aging problem for women. Female pattern baldness (FPB) is more apparent in women who are in their menopause stage. Some women even experience thinning hair at an earlier age, after birth deliveries have occurred.</p>
<p>Natural Treatments</p>
<p>There are a number of natural female baldness treatments that may help in regrowing and revitalizing the hair follicles.</p>
<p>    * Aromatherapy uses essential natural oils that help in controlling hair loss. It is a proven cure. With the proper blend of cedar wood, lavender, thyme, and rosemary essential oils mixed with jojoba oil and grape seed oil applied topically on the scalp produce promising results. Massaging the scalp with these potent oils stimulates hair follicles. Not only does it work on the prevention and control of hair loss but it also works on other bodily aspects as it works in harmony with the body&#8217;s natural healing system.<br />
    * Homeopathy helps in stimulating the natural hormonal balance that is aimed at improving the woman&#8217;s well being. Homeopathic treatment is usually the holistic way of treating menopause, and it is also a natural baldness treatment. It goes with providing men and women with a healthy living mentally, physically, and emotionally.<br />
