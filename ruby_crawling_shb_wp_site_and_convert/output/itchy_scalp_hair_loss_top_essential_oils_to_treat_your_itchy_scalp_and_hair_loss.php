<p>Hair loss caused by an itchy scalp can be extremely frustrating and worrying for anyone, and if left untreated can cause permanent hair loss and baldness resulting in conditions like cicatricial alopecia where the hair follicles are permanently damaged and the hair may never grow back.</p>
<p>It is therefore imperative that you get your condition looked at and diagnosed as soon as possible by a qualified professional, to halt the hair loss problem in its tracks.</p>
<p>In saying this though, there are many natural remedies and essential oils that have been used for centuries by numerous civilizations to soothe, treat and cure itchy scalp and hair loss problems. What&#8217;s better is that you can make these remedies in the comfort of your own home, using cheap and readily available ingredients.</p>
<p>These natural remedies are seeing a revival in modern times as more and more of us lose faith in the large pharmaceutical companies, and we become aware of the growing amount of evidence that shows that perhaps these huge corporations don&#8217;t always have our best interests at heart. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re all bad, just that sometimes the so-called &#8220;modern&#8221; medicine can&#8217;t see the wood for the trees.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s my rant over with! <img src='http://stophairbreakage.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Now, I&#8217;d like to show you the top 3 essential oils that should be an &#8220;essential&#8221; part of any itchy scalp hair loss first-aid kit. If I were going to be stranded on a desert island and could only take 3 things with me, then these would be it&#8230;well, maybe some sun tan lotion too! <img src='http://stophairbreakage.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Please note that essential oils are normally highly concentrated and should therefore always be patch tested prior to application, in case of any allergies or irritation. Always consult your doctor prior to using any remedies or essential oils if you are pregnant or on specific medication.</p>
<p>Top 3 Essential Oils For Itchy Scalp and Hair Loss</p>
<p>Lavender Oil</p>
<p>This wonderful smelling oil is great at fighting off the nasty dandruff fungi, itchy scalp, burning sensations and even lice. Highly popular in aromatherapy, it&#8217;s relaxing smell and anti-inflammatory properties make it one of my faves.</p>
<p>It is particularly effective at stimulating hair growth when combined with other essential oils, like Rosemary.</p>
<p>Rosemary Oil</p>
<p>This fantastic oil should be a part of your hair regrowth arsenal. With a strong woodsy smell, this oil is used extensively in aromatherapy treatments as it can increase concentration and eliminate boredom when inhaled &#8211; particularly useful when studying for an exam.</p>
<p>When massaged into the scalp, it can moisturize the skin, stimulate hair follicles and cause the hair to regrow. It&#8217;s excellent as an anti-dandruff and itchy scalp remedy too, clearing most cases fairly quickly.</p>
<p>It is particularly good if you naturally have oily hair.</p>
<p>Jojoba Oil</p>
<p>This is an excellent oil for controlling dandruff and moisturizing your scalp if it has become dry. It mimics your skin&#8217;s own sebum and is therefore great for hypoallergenic skin. Easily absorbed into the scalp it helps remove deposits of sebum from the hair follicles and nourishes the scalp with B &#038; E vitamins and iodine. If you are suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, eczema or psoriasis, and they are causing your itchy scalp hair loss, then remedies containing jojoba oil can be very effective at neutralizing the problem.</p>
<p>These 3 essential oils are best used when combined with others, and by using a carrier oil which will help to somewhat dilute the potency of them and also make a larger amount of your natural remedy.
