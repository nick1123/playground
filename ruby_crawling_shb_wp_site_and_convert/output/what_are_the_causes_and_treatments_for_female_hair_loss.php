<p>A lot of people have this misconception about hair loss, believing that it only happens among men. However, female hair loss is actually just as big an issue as male hair loss. Studies have shown that men and women experience the same thinning hair problems.</p>
<p>But there is a difference though, which is the pattern. The male baldness pattern involves a receding hairline that is pushed further and further back, eventually making them appear bald. As for women, the hair loss is generally distributed all over the scalp.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding the real cause of female pattern baldness, the factors are varied. Unlike male baldness that is normally caused by genes, hair loss in women actually happens for different reasons. However, there are also women who are suffering hair loss because of heredity. Aside from blaming one&#8217;s genes as a reason for thinning hair, major hair loss causes generally include stress, medication, pregnancy, strong hair chemicals and hormones.</p>
<p>For the most part, if women experience hair loss because of these factors, then there is nothing to worry about, as eventually the hair will simply grow back, once the situation is under control. Sadly though, there are also cases where medications are the only solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>Hair restoration surgery is perhaps the last resort when female hair loss is no longer controllable. But if the situation can still be handled, then there are thinning hair solutions that may serve as great alternatives to surgery. Rogaine and Propecia are the only restoration solutions duly approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>These products are actually effective for men, but only Rogaine is proven safe and effective in treating hair loss in women. Additionally, a restoration system is also another practical alternative for hair loss treatments in women. These solutions include weaves, extensions or wigs.</p>
<p>Although this is not a permanent treatment, most women suffering from hair loss achieve temporary relief with these hair replacement systems. On the other hand, health experts firmly believe that some women experience hair loss simply because of a lack of vitamins, particularly iron and Vitamin C.</p>
<p>For hair that is thinning, some shampoos are also suitable. What these shampoos do is simply eliminate unwanted particles in the hair follicles. Female hair loss is basically a very common problem among women. But women should not worry too much about losing their crowning glory. After all, there are so many solutions available today to cater to such concerns.</p>
