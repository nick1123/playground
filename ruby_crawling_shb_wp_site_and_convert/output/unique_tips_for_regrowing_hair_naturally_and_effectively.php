<p>How long have you been struggling with thinning hair? It&#8217;s without a doubt that you are among the millions of people who have probably used every single hair loss product imaginable. Nothing seems to work nowadays when it comes to regrowing hair and preventing hair loss.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that many just give up and deal with their receding hairlines and other forms of baldness. You don&#8217;t have to do this. It doesn&#8217;t require a hard fight once you know the ropes. Here is one truth regarding why a person loses hair that you should do well to heed.</p>
<p>A lot of times you will hear people say that you lose hair because it&#8217;s totally hereditary and can&#8217;t be stopped. They say it&#8217;s in your genes. Well really this is only partly true. There are things that have to do with our genetics that can cause us to lose hair, but it&#8217;s not the determining factor.</p>
<p>You see most of us lose our hair because of having a high level of DHT within our bodies. DHT is a hormone that leads to hair loss by binding to hair follicle receptor cells. When in high levels, it literally starts to make your hair thinner and thinner.</p>
<p>You can easily stop this by taking various herbs that actually naturally block DHT. One popular one is saw palmetto extract. Taking this herb daily like you would any other vitamin or mineral supplement will certainly keep DHT at bay.</p>
<p>Drinking green tea each day also works excellent. It&#8217;s one of the newest discovered ways to stop hair loss and block this hair loss causing hormone.</p>
