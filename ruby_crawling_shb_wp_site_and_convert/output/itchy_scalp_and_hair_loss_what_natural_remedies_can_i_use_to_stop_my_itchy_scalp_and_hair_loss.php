<p>Itchy scalp and hair loss are fairly common problems that are sometimes distinct problems in themselves, or one can be the cause of the other.</p>
<p>Hair loss can be particularly difficult for the sufferer to deal with, especially if she is a woman &#8211; this is not to say that it&#8217;s not difficult for male sufferers, but many women would identify their femininity with their hair. Also, hair loss can occur at any time in a person&#8217;s life, it is not restricted by age.</p>
<p>Finding the right natural remedy for itchy scalp and hair loss will often depend on what the symptoms are, but there are a number of general good practices that you can begin to get in to which can greatly help the itchy scalp hair loss problem.</p>
<p>Check and Change Your Shampoo</p>
<p>In many cases an itchy scalp and hair loss will become aggravated and worsened by continual use of harsh oil-stripping shampoos. What may surprise you is how many of the so-called &#8220;soft and sensitive&#8221; shampoos contain strong industrial strength de-greasing chemicals.</p>
<p>By choosing a natural shampoo &#8211; ideally containing Zinc Pyrithione in its natural form, which is a great anti-fungal ingredient and can be effective for treating itchy scalp conditions such as Psoriasis, and Sebhorreic Dermatitis &#8211; you can begin to stop the irritation on your scalp and return the skin to its normal pH balance.</p>
<p>Essential Oils</p>
<p>Adding essential oils like Tea Tree and Rosemary to your shampoo will cleanse and soothe the skin, while Lavender will stimulate hair growth. (Please patch test all essential oils prior to use, as some people have certain sensitivities or allergies to natural oils).</p>
<p>Jojoba &#8211; great for treating seborrhea, eczema, psoriasis, or dandruff. Jojoba (pronounced ho-ho-ba) oil has been used for centuries by Mexicans and Southwestern Native American nations to promote hair growth and the control of dandruff. It&#8217;s a great moisturizer and mimics the scalp&#8217;s own sebum. It absorbs readily into the scalp and helps remove deposits of sebum from the hair follicles, neutralizes acidity, and nourishes the scalp with all the B vitamins, vitamin E, silicon, copper, zinc, chromium, and iodine.</p>
<p>Aloe Vera &#8211; used by Native Americans, Indians and many in the Caribbean to promote healthy hair and prevent hair loss. It can help the scalp by healing it and balancing the pH level while cleansing the pores. A common preparation of Aloe Vera gel with a small amount of wheat germ oil and coconut milk is used as a shampoo and has traditionally shown great benefit.</p>
<p>Massage</p>
<p>A vigorous rubbing of the scalp with fingers after washing the hair with cold water can help to stimulate hair growth. The scalp should be rubbed vigorously till it starts to tingle with the heat. By doing this you activate the sebaceous glands and energise the circulation of blood in the affected area, which can encourage the hair to grow back. Be careful with this technique if you have a very sore scalp or any broken skin, as you may aggravate your condition. Also, take care to avoid causing unnecessary damage with your fingernails. If you have long fingernails you can perform the massage using your flattened palm.</p>
<p>Finding out the cause of your itchy scalp hair loss is essential to finding the right treatment.</p>
