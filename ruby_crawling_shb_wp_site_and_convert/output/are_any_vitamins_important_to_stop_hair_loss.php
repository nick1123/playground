<p>While you might think you are doing everything you can to prevent and to treat hair loss, you may not be doing enough. All of the treatments and products in the world aren&#8217;t going to help if you&#8217;re not nourishing the rest of the body that&#8217;s attached to your scalp. You need to think of your baldness as something that can affect and can be assisted by other habits you have &#8211; like a poor diet. In addition to putting the vitamins directly onto your hair, you might also want to put a few in your mouth.</p>
<p>The B vitamin family is one of the main supporters of hair strand health. Niacin and Pantothenic Acid will not only boost the appearance of your hair, but they will also work to help your hair grow stronger and fuller. These B vitamins have been linking with stopping and preventing hair loss. You can find these vitamins in supplement form or in whole grains, organ meats, and egg yolks.</p>
<p>Antioxidants help to repair damage in the body on a cellular level, so it only makes sense that these would also help your hair grow stronger. Choose vitamins A, C, and E to help you promote shine as well as healthier hair follicles.</p>
<p>Biotin is a mineral which can help to produce keratin, which is one of the building blocks of your hair. By taking in this supplement, you will begin to encourage the hair to grow long and strong.</p>
<p>Inositol is another supplement that will help you work on your hair from the inside out. By helping the hair follicle work as it should, you can make sure the hair growth cycle doesn&#8217;t slow down.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s better to find these vitamins and minerals in your local grocery store, taking a supplement each day can help ensure that you are getting the maximum levels for hair health.</p>
