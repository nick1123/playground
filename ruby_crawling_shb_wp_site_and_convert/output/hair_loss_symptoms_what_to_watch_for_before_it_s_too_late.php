<p>Inherited Hair Loss<br />
While many people already know about inherited hair loss, there are certain things to look at regarding it. Many times you can gauge the family traits just by going to a family reunion. If it runs in the family, many times you will notice that your male pattern baldness will end up the same way as a relative.

<p>Alopecia Areata<br />
This occurs when you start seeing patches of hair falling out. Unfortunately it isn&#8217;t anything you have done personally, but instead an immune system issue. See, when your hair follicles are attacked in this manner then the loss of hair is imminent. The bad news is this usually happens at a younger age and usually before someone reaches the age of twenty. The good news is your hair grows back most of the time within the first year. However, it could be white and very thin.</p>
<p>Stress and Trichotillomania<br />
Trichotillomania is a condition and compulsive disorder. It happens when someone continuously pulls on the hair. This is one of the hair loss symptoms that is due to extra stress put on an individual. It can happen because of work, the home life, a traumatic event, or several other scenarios. On occasion you can end up with broken pieces of hair, seeing your eyebrows thin, and of course the patches.</p>

Sure there are many medications and methods you can try to do, but in the end you may end up wasting your money. Can you imagine if there was a way to re-grow hair that would have a 100% positive result?</p>
